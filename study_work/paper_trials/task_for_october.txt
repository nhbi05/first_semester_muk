semantic errors are errors due to improper use of pogram statements
logical error is an error due to the fact that  the specificaion is not respected
a programming language is a formal system of notation used to write computer prgrams
an algorithm is a set of rules that a computer must follw to perform a specific task
a program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task

difference between logical and relational operators
Relational operators compare values and return a boolean, true or false. They're the backbone of many conditional statements in programming:
== checks if two values are equal.
!= checks if two values are not equal.
> and < check if one value is greater or less than another.
>= and <= check if one value is greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to another.
Logical operators, on the other hand, combine multiple boolean expressions and return a boolean:

&& (AND) returns true if both conditions are true.

|| (OR) returns true if at least one condition is true.

! (NOT) inverts the truth value of the condition.


Difference between keywords and identifiers
Keywords are reserved words in a programming language that have a specific meaning and cannot be used as identifiers.
Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, and other program elements.

Difference between operators and symbols
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations. eg+, - ==
Symbols are characters used to represent values, such as numbers, strings, and booleans.e.g [ for lists], #for comments etc

Rules that must be followed when choosing a name of a pytho n identifier such as a variable
The name of a variable should be a valid identifier in Python, which means it should follow these rules
Shouldn't startt with a number
Shouldn't contain any special characters except for underscores
Shouldn't be a reserved keyword in Python

QUESTION two
What is the difference between a function and a method?
A function is a block of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of a program,
A method 

wrting a program that accepts marks for four course units and calculates the average grade for a dtudent based on the following grading scale

name = input( 'What is your name?')
course1 = int(input(What marks did you get? ))
course2 = int(input(What marks did you get?))
course3 = int(input(What marks did you get?))
course4 = int(input(What marks did you get?))
